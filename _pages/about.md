Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put pictures in, too. Add them to the `assets/img/` folder and list them under `profile.images` in this page's front matter to enable the built-in photo switcher (click the picture to cycle through them, or keep using `profile.image` for a single photo).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
