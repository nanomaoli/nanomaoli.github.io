Howdy! I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Minnesota. I am currently working with [Prof. Zirui Liu](https://zirui-ray-liu.github.io/) on research in machine learning and systems.

My recent projects explore **reproducible long-context reasoning** in LLMs and **elastic KV cache infrastructure** for GPU sharing across models. Broadly, I enjoy investigating the intersection of algorithms and systems to make AI both more efficient and more reliable.

I am always open to new discussions and collaborations. If you have ideas or questions youâ€™d like to share, feel free to reach out!

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
